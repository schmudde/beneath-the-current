Yeah - I’ve always liked the arrangement of this track. Front 242’s sound form the 1980s is still quite mysterious to me. Hard to capture. But there are a few places to focus, such as the punchy/breathy snare sound in *Masterhit.* I also hear that snare sound in this Liebknecht track (snare really hits around 3m35s. I love how deep it is in the mix and yet how it’s still punchy as fuck):

In hindsight, it makes a lot of sense that this is Haujobb.

What I like about this track is its crunchy distorted drums. Simple 4/4 with some slight changes in the high-hat that give it some flow. I’d like to do something a little abstract with droning synth ala this or Coil. 

So this is kind of what you’re thinking about using the Drum Brute for? I can see why it could be useful for this type of sound. .


## Nine Inch Nails

My influence of NIN is deep, but as I get older I less want to be Trent and look for little things that I found very sonically interesting.

I would like to do something like this with a driving bass-line that is the foundation with a bunch of electronic shit on top. 

Wow - cool. *Fixed* and *Recoiled* are peak NIN/Coil, obviously. In many ways it’s more ambitious than looking at Front 242 or Depeche Mode. But this is actually reflects my own goals with music. Create something *musical* (Depeche Mode), *rhythmic* (Front 242), but above all *deeply atmospheric* (Coil). If it is the background music of a Tibetan Buddhist death cult, prize fighter walkout music, and sampled on dance floor dungeon, we have far exceeded anything else I have ever produced.

Speaking of Tibetan death cults - I’m quite interested in exploring these themes of fear and death, orgasm and ecstasy, and also equanimity. Like you are alluding to in Coil, I’m attracted to music that is deeply self-reflexive and produces spiral, circular, and paradoxical sonic shapes. 

## Depeche Mode

Obviously they really know how to write a hook. Always something I have in the back of my mind, but not something I am trying to accomplish.

This track I think has a good balance to their pop sensibility which actually having some gritty synth.

## Coil

Music for degenerates to fuck to.

- I love the circular nature of this track. Without percussion it creates this whirling effect.
- This track is brilliant.

Very simple song, I’d like to start with something along these lines while we figure things out. 

I really admire this music - I’m not sure if I have anything *new* to say in this format. But I like crafting hooks and mesmerizing basslines. Perhaps you can makeup for the rest of my shortcomings here.

Right there isn’t anything *new,* but has a great foundation to work off of. Lets just see if I can right some mesmerizing bassline hooks.

So good. That train rhythm, the bass, the messy guitar…

It’s not evil enough to be Coil, but I love the synth work.

# Ideology 
## Vocals

So my singing isn’t great and in project[4] my voice was still changing. I tried hard to sing outside of my range. If do take more of a vocal lead (which you have eluded to), it would be in the lower octaves. Something like Leonard Cohen, Michael Gira, John Balance (something akin to Are You Shivering?) to name a few. 

John Balance. That’s a surprise. But I get what you’re saying. I’ll add that one of the pop things I’m interested in is harmony. The first time I was in Berlin, I saw the best jazz concert I ever saw at the A-Train. Rudy Stevenson’s group. What I loved is the band would do this free jazz stuff and then out of the chaos emerged this beautiful melody. And then it would all fall apart again. Maybe a little like my experience seeing Einstruzende Neubauten live. It would be cool to do some John Balance stuff or spoken Leonard Cohen, and then have some lush chorus emerge.

## Percussion

I have been starting here but know anything we do in this realm is always up for change and debate. I have just been starting here since I find it easier to riff off of something even if its just a simple 4/4 Kick Snare beat. Previously all the drums (unless played live) were just programmed into a DAW and rearranged. I am trying to get comfortable with a physical machine to get it started. Feels less like programming. How did you do it previously?

I was actually quite happy with my drum programming. I never used a physical machine. It always started by playing a bit and moving things around on the piano roll. For *Idly By Dawn* I used a lot of slicing things up in Reason samplers as well.

Eventually it would be nice if you programmed on the drum machine but also recorded the MIDI along with the audio. The MIDI would ideally start at beat 1/1 with a MIDI signal that tells your drum machine what samples to load (or settings on the Brute). While I couldn’t actually fuck with those sounds, I could also edit the MIDI a bit, and you would just hear the changes when you pressed play on your machine.

I dig the drum samples in these tracks:

Listening to these songs back to back makes me think that this remix of “Only” is the most Front 242 interpretation of NIN.

## Lyrics and Themes 

Lyrics and themes are tough here. Any thoughts? Regarding samples - I’m interested in paranoia, distance (from the self, from the other), and self-doubt. Before we started talking about this, I was kind of interested in pulling in some Iron Curtain/Cold War themes through radio transmissions. These distant, fuzzy, hard to understand transmissions from “the other” that are in the air. A few influences:


- [High Static, Dead Lines: Sonic Spectres & the Object Hereafter](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/41169802-high-static-dead-lines) (haven’t read it but love the idea)
- [The Soundscape: Our Environment and the Tuning of the World](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/585024.The_Soundscape) (it used to be my core textbook in my Sound Design class)
- I’m also thinking about Adam Curtis’ media ghosts that he was presenting at the show we went to. Part of the point is the past traps our possible futures.

The new Godspeed You! Black Emperor picks up on some of these paranoid/empire surveillance themes: https://open.spotify.com/album/1RDLG5wi0a2Lrgdxs32tKL?si=bKCAuOcFQXmRI-24RYVTuA.

## Synth

More synth solos.

## Bass

Foreboding sleeze. Or a chilly electronic distance. The most intense basslines are those that are a little uncomfortable but you feel them in your bones. Even something out of our range, like Pink Floyd’s *Money*. It’s so prominent, but it’s in 7/8 time signature. It doesn’t quite add up. Phenom bass line.

## Guitar

I think I really only want to use guitar as accent in tracks. I don’t generally don’t feel comfortable with a guitar driven track. 

## Samples

So an idea that you might be interested in. Samples in terms of a pack in which we start from. Just kicking the tires on an idea of creating our own sample pack. So we have a pack of 4 of each drum section. We build out like 8 bass, 8 poly, 8 other synths, etc. To sort of narrow us (me) in a little. I dont know how much you are using samples currently. I am thinking of this kinda like a painters palette.



# Perspiration 
## project[4] History

In these two tracks I think there is still something there that I like. My singing is not one of them.

Yeah - I dig your voice on the second track. I also like how it’s mixed.


# Current Tracks
## One Hundred Years

I will come back to this eventually. I don’t want to do the guitars they way they are so I am thinking about how to do that differently. 


## Untitled Drum Track

Just testing some stuff out.

## Haze

@Ryan D - I wrote this at Kitchen Table Coders. A sort of hazy night - not sure what to do next with my marriage. Typical workflow for me. Pen and paper and then brought it to the Atari ST. Last night I resurrected it from the Atari ST. Tonight I setup the tracks in ButtWiggle.

I believe it is in the key of E minor. But haven’t looked. There is a key modulation 2/3 of the way through. I think it might help for me to offer the chord progressions in the future? Let me know what you think and what might help you jump into a track like this.

One thing I’d like to point out - this is an example of my process where I focus on getting the music written first and then worry about the tones later. Starting with good music, it’s easier for me to find a good tone. Starting with good tones, I can’t always find the music.

I didn’t spend a lot of time on the synth wizardry here and I know nothing about the synths in ButtWiggle. But I had a really cool sound on my rig at KTC. But I think the potential shines through even though I haven’t spent much time crafting the soundscape.

# My Motherfucking Cloud

I always forget credentials and the URL for My Cloud
https://web.wd2go.com/login.do?brand=webfiles

I have started rsyncing all projects to the drive after I am done. The whole Bitwig folder. So if we use my computer as the “master” the NFS will always be in sync with it. Thinking that if you do your updates and publish here or somewhere, I can grab them and it creates a one directional cycle.  Just a thought.
